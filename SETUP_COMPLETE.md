# 🎯 Configuration Complete!

Your Habit Tracker is now fully configured for GitHub Pages deployment with hash-based routing.

## ✅ What's Been Done

### 1. Hash-Based Routing Implementation
- ✅ Converted from path-based (`/habits`) to hash-based (`/#/habits`) routing
- ✅ All navigation now uses `window.location.hash` instead of `window.history`
- ✅ Works perfectly with GitHub Pages (no 404 errors on refresh)

### 2. Build Configuration
- ✅ Set `base: '/habit_tracker/'` in vite.config.ts
- ✅ Added `homepage` to package.json
- ✅ Installed gh-pages package

### 3. Automated Deployment
- ✅ Created GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- ✅ Deploys to `shyguyrymakesai.github.io` user site repo
- ✅ Builds and pushes to `/habit_tracker/` folder automatically
- ✅ **Requires**: Personal Access Token setup as `PAT_PUSH` secret (see `TOKEN_SETUP.md`)

### 4. Documentation
- ✅ Updated README.md with live demo link
- ✅ Created DEPLOYMENT.md (detailed deployment guide)
- ✅ Created GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md (quick reference)
- ✅ Created TOKEN_SETUP.md (PAT setup instructions)

### 5. GitHub Pages Optimization
- ✅ Added `.nojekyll` file to prevent Jekyll processing
- ✅ Configured for static deployment

## 🌐 Your Live URLs

**Base URL**: `https://shyguyrymakesai.github.io/habit_tracker`

All routes use hash routing:
- 🏠 Home: `https://shyguyrymakesai.github.io/habit_tracker/#/`
- 🎯 Habits: `/#/habits`
- 💊 Medications: `/#/medications`
- ⭐ Ratings: `/#/ratings`
- 💫 Quotes: `/#/quotes`
- 📈 Trends: `/#/trends`
- 📜 History: `/#/history`
- ⚙️ Settings: `/#/settings`

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### First-Time Setup Required

**Before you can deploy, you must:**

1. **Create a Personal Access Token**:
   - Follow instructions in `TOKEN_SETUP.md`
   - Generate a PAT with `repo` scope
   - Add it as `DEPLOY_TOKEN` secret in habit_tracker repository

2. **Ensure user site exists**:
   - Repository `shyguyrymakesai/shyguyrymakesai.github.io` must exist
   - GitHub Pages must be enabled on that repo

### Then Deploy

#### Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```
GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy to your user site!

#### Option 2: Manual
```bash
npm run build
# Then manually copy dist/* to shyguyrymakesai.github.io/habit_tracker/
```

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Set up deployment token** (REQUIRED):
   - Read `TOKEN_SETUP.md` for step-by-step instructions
   - Create a Personal Access Token on GitHub
   - Add it as `PAT_PUSH` secret in the habit_tracker repo

2. **Verify user site repo exists**:
   - Check that `shyguyrymakesai/shyguyrymakesai.github.io` exists
   - Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled on that repo
3. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment with token auth"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Monitor deployment**:
   - Check Actions tab: `https://github.com/shyguyrymakesai/habit_tracker/actions`
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for build and deploy

5. **Verify in user site repo**:
   - Check `shyguyrymakesai.github.io` repo for new files in `/habit_tracker/`
   
6. **Visit your live site**: 
   `https://shyguyrymakesai.github.io/habit_tracker/#/`

## 🧪 Testing Before Deploy
