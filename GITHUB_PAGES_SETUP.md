- ✅ Installed `gh-pages` package

### ⚙️ vite.config.ts
- ✅ Added `base: '/habit_tracker/'` for correct asset paths

### 🔄 src/main.tsx
- ✅ Converted from path-based routing to hash-based routing
- ✅ Changed from `window.location.pathname` to `window.location.hash`
- ✅ Changed from `history.pushState` to `window.location.hash`
- ✅ Changed from `popstate` to `hashchange` event

### 🤖 .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- ✅ Created automated deployment workflow
- ✅ Triggers on push to `main` branch
- ✅ Builds and deploys automatically

### 📁 public/.nojekyll
- ✅ Prevents Jekyll processing on GitHub Pages

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server at localhost:5173

# Production
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run deploy       # Deploy to GitHub Pages (manual)

# Deployment
git push origin main # Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions
```

## URLs After Deployment

🌐 **Live Site**: `https://shyguyrymakesai.github.io/habit_tracker/#/`

### All Routes (with hash):
- Home: `/#/`
- Habits: `/#/habits`
- Medications: `/#/medications`
- Ratings: `/#/ratings`
- Quotes: `/#/quotes`
- Trends: `/#/trends`
- History: `/#/history`
- Settings: `/#/settings`

## How It Works

1. **Hash Routing**: All routes use `#` (e.g., `/#/habits`)
2. **No Server Routing**: Hash is never sent to server, handled by browser
3. **Works on Refresh**: Any URL works when shared or refreshed
4. **GitHub Pages Compatible**: Static hosting with client-side routing

## Deployment Flow

```
Push to main
    ↓
GitHub Actions triggered
    ↓

    ↓
Live in 1-2 minutes! 🎉
```

## Next Steps

1. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure for GitHub Pages with hash routing"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages** (if not already):
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Source: GitHub Actions
   - Save

3. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for deployment

4. **Visit your site**:
   `https://shyguyrymakesai.github.io/habit_tracker/#/`

## Testing Locally

Before deploying, test the production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
