- **Deploy Location**: `/habit_tracker/` subfolder
- **Live URL**: `https://shyguyrymakesai.github.io/habit_tracker/#/`

### Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-to-user-site.yml`

## 🛠️ Workflow Breakdown

```yaml
name: Build & Publish to user site
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

# Two jobs:
# 1. build - Compiles your React app
# 2. publish - Deploys to user site repo
```

**Build job:**
- Checks out your code
- Installs dependencies
- Runs `npm run build`
- Uploads dist folder as artifact

**Publish job:**
- Checks out user site repo using `PAT_PUSH`
- Downloads build artifact
- Copies files to `/habit_tracker/` folder
- Commits and pushes to user site

## 💡 Tips

### Manual Deploy
Trigger deployment without pushing code:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Build & Publish to user site"
3. Click "Run workflow"

### Local Testing
Test production build before deploying:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
Visit: `http://localhost:4173/habit_tracker/#/`

### Troubleshooting
- **404 Error**: Check base path in vite.config.ts
- **Blank Page**: Check browser console for errors
- **Routes Don't Work**: Ensure hash routing is used (`/#/page`)
